# Critical Discussion of the Technology and Its Applications

## Social and Political Implications

In social implications, particularly in the aspect of higher education, there is an overreliance with ChatGPT technology and this could potentially reduce critical thinking skills as easy access to “answers” might encourage academic dishonesty. It’s hard for instructors to know if the student really learned the material. In general use, it can give inaccurate information.

“ChatGPT can sometimes “hallucinate,” a term used to describe the tendency for such models to respond with inaccurate or misleading information” (Archives of Britannica, 2025).

As far as any political concerns with ChatGPT, Chinese researchers have found that ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, is seeing a rightward shift in political values. This study performed several thousand tests and they found there were different values and bias within the different ChatGPT models. If one were to ask the ChatGPT bot about politics, they would find that the bot that learns and adapts would build up based off user feedback and that is an issue. Polarising world events, like the Russia-Ukraine war, could also amplify what users are asking the LLMs and the resulting answers they get. This indicates that AI chatbots could be having hallucinations, and it shows there is a harm with misinformation as it is not specialised and those risks should be carefully evaluated.

## Ethical Lenses

### Utilitarianism

**Pros:** Boosts productivity and helps people attain knowledge quickly and helps students who don’t have tutors.  
**Cons:** Harms education if misused and misinformation is often generated through AI hallucinations and it can even lead to job loss.

### Deontology

**Focus:** To understand if the action is right or wrong regardless of the outcome.  
**Application:** ChatGPT has an issue to cheat which violates the duty of honesty. In terms of privacy within ChatGPT, the users have a duty to protect their personal data but they often don’t know what’s being stored within the memory of the program. In conclusion, some uses of ChatGPT are unethical no matter the benefit when it comes down to honesty and integrity being at risk and potentially compromised.

## Medical Ethics

A closer look at ChatGPT’s new ethical implications for medical AI shows that there are possible bioethical issues emerging from the use of ChatGPT within the medical field. There is even a bias within the medical field as researchers deep dived into them, such as when “Cohen uses an example where an algorithm was found to prioritize treatment for white patients over equally sick black patients.”

## How Ethical Lenses Influence Social Impacts

The way we perceive the social impacts of ChatGPT technology on the ethical lens we apply structures perspectives on the different ethical frameworks to and different interpretations of whether the technology is “good” or “harmful.”

## Interpreting Technology in Social Contexts

ChatGPT may be seen as purposeful when it comes to assisting in writing an email or even attaining quick references within the workplace, but it is unethical and an honor code violation within a classroom.

Ethical lenses help us comprehend why people disagree about the role of ChatGPT within society and be able to remind everyone that tech isn’t neutral and it can be controlled with a set designated agenda and “ethics as a philosophical discipline that is mostly concerned with examining or justifying prescriptive rules and statements has a written history of several millennia.”
