## Introduction of Technology

### What technology did the team choose?

ChatGPT.

### Provide a good introduction to what the chosen technology is

ChatGPT is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that understands and writes human-like text. It’s based on a powerful technology called “transformers,” which helps it learn by reading a huge amount of text from books, websites, and other sources.

It can answer questions, write emails, explain things, or even help with homework. Think of it like a super-smart autocomplete—it doesn't just guess the next word, it understands what you're trying to say and responds in a helpful way.

### Why did the team choose it? (in other words, why does the tech matter?)

We chose ChatGPT because it stands out as one of the most influential tools of our time. Since its release, it has rapidly transformed how students learn, how individuals manage everyday tasks, and how companies operate across industries.
